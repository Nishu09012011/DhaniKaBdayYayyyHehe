 <p>I don't know what type of virtues I did in my past life to have met and become close with someone like you,It's almost unreal how we've known each other for 3 years like damn I remember when we first talked. I must've for sure maxxed out my luck points before being born to have even been this fortunate.I seriously mean every one of these things that I am saying and I really hope that you liked this goofy website that I made and don't worry it's not public only you can see it,I know it looks choppy and everything but I haven't programmed in like over years so I tried yk hehe. Just know you mean the most a person probably means to me and that you're the one who motivates me to keep living,keep becoming better and overall want to succeed in life.It is unreal how much of an effect and impact you have had in my life and that in the positive sense. I make mistakes and I will make more but I will promise to own up to them ,make up for them and further solve them. I promise you one day that I'll feed you all your favourite cuisines and learn the guitar riffs to your favourite songs so that we can jam together(I really will). Looking back at ourselves last year I can say for a fact that this year definitely brought both positives and negatives in our lives and hey that's okay. If there is light there is darkness and if there is yin there is yang. I'm so fucking fucking proud of you for all the accomplishments which you have done,Don't think that No one sees your wins (even the smallest ones) because I watch and celebrate each of them. Don't be too harsh on yourself you are human afterall and it is infact your first time living. I hope that the bad in your life dies out just like that fatass gahori's parents and the good blooms in. And just remember that if the world is against you ,I'm against the world and even if it means so I'll fight against God with you. Let's let today be a memorable day and cherish it in our memories. :D</p>
